      <h2 class="grey">Research</h2>
      <p class="bodyp">I am in my final year of my BSc in Astrophysics in 
      University College Cork, Ireland. I've had good experience in Optical and X-ray
      astronomy over the past two summers and I'm currently working on a 
      publication which is briefly described below.

      The largest and brightest globular cluster associated with our galaxy, w
      Cen, was one of the first globular clusters to be observed with the 
      <i>Chandra X-ray Observatory</i>. Since then, it has been the subject of 
      numerous research papers due to its large and diverse population of stars.
      It is also so different from other galactic globular clusters that it has 
      been suggested that w Cen is all that remains of a smaller galaxy that was
      captured by the Milky Way <a href="URL">(Noyola et al. 2008)</a>. It is a
      GC that evokes much curiosity from the astronomy community.
      
      <br><br>The aim
      of this project is to produce a high-quality, high-detailed list of X-ray-emitting sources contained within. This sort of census will be very 
      interesting to GC observers and theorists; those
      who want to discover how the cluster formed and how its stars interact 
      would value studies based on carefully analysed X-ray data.
      A previous survey of sources in w Cen produced a list of 45-70 cluster members including sources such as 
      cataclysmic variables and a quiescent neutron star <a href="URL">
