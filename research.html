      <h1 class="yank">Research</h1>
      <p class="bodyp">I am in my final year of my BSc in Astrophysics in University College
      Cork, Ireland. I have had employment experience in X-ray astronomy over 
      the past two summers. I am currently working on one project which is 
      briefly described below.
      </p>
      <h3 class="yank">Omega Centauri</h3>
      <p class="bodyp">
      Omega Centauri, the Milky Way’s most massive and enigmatic old stellar 
      cluster, offers a treasure trove of astronomical discovery and 
      controversy. Is the cluster a globular or a dwarf galaxy remnant? What
      are the origins and dynamical histories of the cluster’s multiple stellar
      populations? Does a population of millisecond pulsars lurk just below 
      detection limits? Does it host a massive central black hole? 
      Collaborators have recently completed a sensitive X-ray search for an
      intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) in ω Cen, which yielded no evidence for accretion-
      related emission from the cluster's core (Haggard et al. 2013).
      <br><br>
      ω Cen has also yielded an additional mystery: a population of X-ray 
      sources seemingly coincident with its metal-rich "anomalous" red and 
      subgiant branches. We were recently awarded multi-epoch, multi-slit, 
      medium resolution spectroscopy from Gemini-S/GMOS (PI: Haggard) to 
      study seven of these X-ray sources. We plan to measure radial velocities
      to search for binarity and establish cluster membership, and to make the
      preliminary metallicity measurements necessary to associate them with 
      one of ω Cen’s numerous giant branches.
