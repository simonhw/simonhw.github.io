      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Cork, Ireland. I currently live there while I await conferring of my undergraduate
         degree in Astrophysics in University College Cork. I have been accepted to complete a research Masters in X-ray astronomy in UCC for the coming academic term. My favourite hobbies and biggest passions are archery and scouting.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Archery</h3>
      <p>I am currently the captain of the <a href="http://www.uccarcheryclub.com/">UCC Archery Club</a> for the 2014/2015 term. I have been a member of the club since September '12 and a squad
     member since Spring '13. I train twice a week at home and with UCC and the 
     <a href="http://www.corkcityarcheryclub.ie/">Cork City Archery Club</a>. I own a 70"/36# Cartel Fantom. My indoor
     record is 496/600, which is quite respectable for an intermediate archer. I served as Treasurer for the 2013/2014 term.

      <h3>Scouting</h3>
      <p>I have been involved in Scouting for over 18 years. I started in Beavers at the age of 4 and progressed through Cubs,
     Scouts, Ventures, and Rovers. These days I am a Cub leader in the 4th Cork troop. I love working with young people and
     leading them on the kinds of adventures I had when I was a youth member. In the summer of 2012 we took our Scouts and Ventures
     to the World Scout Centre in Kandersteg, Switzerland. This year we are going to Gilwell in London. Scouting is one of the most character-building and enabling environments for youths and adults alike. I owe much of who I am today to the experiences I have in Scouting.
