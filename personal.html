      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Cork, Ireland. I currently live there while I complete my undergraduate
         degree in Astrophysics in University College Cork. I am keen to travel outside the country to pursue a higher
         degree once I graduate in September '14. When I'm not drowning in assignments and other work, my favourite hobbies
         (and biggest passions) are archery and scouting.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Archery</h3>
      <p>I have been a member of <a href="http://www.uccarcheryclub.com/">UCC Archery Club</a> since September '13 and a squad
     member for over 9 month. I practise for hours at a time twice a week both with UCC and with 
     <a href="http://www.corkcityarcheryclub.ie/">Cork City Archery Club</a>. I own a 70"/32# Cartel Fantom. My indoor
     record in 445/600, which is respectable for someone at my level.</p>

      <h3>Scouting</h3>
      <p>I have been involved in Scouting for almost 18 years. I started in Beavers at the age of 4 and progressed through Cubs,
     Scouts, Ventures, and Rovers. Now, I am a Cub and Venture leader with 4th Cork. I love working with young people and
     leading them on the kinds of adventures I had when I was a youth member. Last summer we took our Scouts and Ventures
     to the World Scout Centre in Kandersteg, Switzerland. Scouting is one of the most character-building and enabling environments for youths and adults alike. I owe much of who I am today to the experiences I have in Scouting.</p>
