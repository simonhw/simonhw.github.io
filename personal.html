      <h3>Archery</h3>
      <p>I am currently the captain of the <a href="http://archery.ucc.ie/">UCC Archery Club</a> for the 2014/2015 term. I have been a member of the club since September '12 and a squad member since Spring '13. I train three times a week with UCC and the <a href="http://www.corkcityarcheryclub.ie/">Cork City Archery Club</a>. I own a Sebastian Flute Elite+ with 70"/36# Cartel Fantom limbs. My indoor record is 514/600 on a 40cm face, which is quite a respectable score. I won four medals in the six 2013/2014 intervarsities, three second place and one third place. I came second place in the NUIG intervarsity of 2014/2015 and progressed to the advanced recurve category. I served as Treasurer for the 2013/2014 term with UCC. For the academic year '14/'15 I am the Athlete Protection Officer for the ISAA (Irish Student Archery Association).

      <h3>Scouting</h3>
        <p>I have been involved in Scouting for over 18 years. I started in Beavers at the age of 4 and progressed through Cubs, Scouts, Ventures, and Rovers. These days I am a Cub leader in the 4th Cork troop. I love working with young people andleading them on the kinds of adventures I had when I was a youth member. In the summer of 2012 we took our Scouts and Ventures to the World Scout Centre in Kandersteg, Switzerland. In 2014 we camped for 10 days in the Lodge Scout Park near Southgate in London. Scouting is one of the most character-building and enabling environments for youths and adults alike. I owe much of who I am today to the experiences I have in Scouting.
